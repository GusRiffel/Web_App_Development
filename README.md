# Web_App_Development

Assessment work created for web application development. Basic website using HTML,CSS, JS and node.js api to supply data to the DB.
The app allows the user to creates points of interest in real time and have it appended to a map using LeafLet library. A promised base Node.JS ORM was also used as a way to go beyond what as asked for in the assessment.
